# Decentralized Voting System

**Created by Orhan HuseinbegoviÄ‡**

The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based application designed to enable users to create voting polls and participate in polls created by others. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this system ensures transparency and security in the voting process.

## Features
- **Create Voting Polls**: Users can create their own polls on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Secure Voting**: Users can vote only once for each poll.
- **Immutable Polls**: Once a poll is made active, the vote publisher cannot stop or modify it.
- **Decentralized**: All data is securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust.

## How It Works
1. **Vote Publisher**: Creates and publishes a voting poll on the Ethereum blockchain. Vote publisher can also be voter, but can't vote for his voting polls
2. **Voter**: Can vote on polls created by others but cannot vote on their own polls. Each voter is restricted to one vote per poll.
3. **Transparency**: Once published, the poll is immutable, ensuring a fair and decentralized voting process.
